#
# Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits
# from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
# The given num does not contain any leading zero.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
# Output: "1219"
# Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219
# which is the smallest.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: num = "10200", k = 1
# Output: "200"
# Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output
# must not contain leading zeroes.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input: num = "10", k = 2
# Output: "0"
# Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with
# nothing which is 0.
